# Smart space station and shuttle security system

It's a demo project for iss security... 

We all know we have 0 gravity in space. 
So everything is floating around inside ISS or space shuttle. 
For this reason we r using  sensors to detect any small object which r floating inside. 
These small objects may be harmful for both the astronauts and the instruments. 
sensors will detect these objects and it will also be detected in infrared / Thermal camera. 
window scanner will be used to scan windows if it is damaged or not. 
The whole System could be controlled via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi using mobile app or any other Software controlled device. 
When the system detects floating object or anything suspicious in the Space Station / Shuttle, 
it will inform the astronauts and the alarm will be triggered automatically.  


If any space object makes an impact on the shuttle or ISS,  sensors will detect that and it will show the damaged area. 
It will notify the astronauts to take necessary steps.
